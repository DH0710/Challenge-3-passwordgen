# Challenge-3-passwordgen

added the necessary functions needed in js for the criteria to populate in the password gen function. 
I made a function for lower case, upper case, symbools, and numbers. 
Once you hit the generate password button, a series of prompts will appear asking if you want lowercase, uppercase, numbers and/or symbols. 
each of these functions have a return just in case an invalid response is entered in any of the prompts.
